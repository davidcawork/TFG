# Thesis Latex Projects

  
The generation of the TFG memory is based on two different LaTeX projects, **david_carrascal-TFG** y **portada-uah_eps-TFG**

The reason that there are two different projects to generate a single memory is because we wanted to use two different templates to get the best of each one. One of them is the template developed by J.Macias for the students of the UAH (University of Alcal√°), and the other one is the template generated by Jose Manuel Requena Plens (University of Alicante). Here are the links to these templates:

- [UAH template created by J.Macias](www.depeca.uah.es/images/plantillas/book-latex.zip).
- [UA template created by J.M Requena](github.com/jmrplens/TFG-TFM_EPS).

From the UAH template, we have used the parts standardized by the university that every TFG memory must have (front, back cover, court scoring sheet). And as for the University of Alicante's template, all its styles, fonts, packages and organizational structure have been used, all of which are included in its template.

It has been a challenge to integrate both templates as one was designed to be compiled with pdfLatex and the other was designed to be compiled with XeLaTeX, so the workflow established to work with both is as follows:

1. Generate pdf with project TFG covers  **portada-uah_eps-TFG**.
2. Add the pdf with the covers in the main project, **david_carrascal-TFG**
3. Compile the main project, **david_carrascal-TFG**, with XeLaTeX to generate the final memory. The pdf with the covers is included directly to the pdf resulting from the TFG memory in order to avoid integration problems between both projects.

If you need to generate new covers, you should modify the project by which the covers are generated, obtain the pdf with the updated covers and include it in the main project of the TFG memory (**david_carrascal-TFG**).
